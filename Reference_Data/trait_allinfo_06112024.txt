MONDO:0042981	aortic valve stenosis	Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is a condition characterized by narrowing of the heart's aortic valve opening. This narrowing prevents the valve from opening fully, which obstructs blood flow from the heart into the aorta, and onward to the rest of the body. AVS can range from mild to severe. Signs and symptoms typically develop when the narrowing of the opening is severe and may include chest pain (angina) or tightness; shortness of breath or fatigue (especially during exertion); feeling faint or fainting; heart palpitations; and heart murmur. Individuals with less severe congenital AVS (present at birth) may not develop symptoms until adulthood. Individuals with severe cases may faint without warning. AVS can have several causes including abnormal development before birth (such as having 1 or 2 valve leaflets instead of 3); calcium build-up on the valve in adulthood; and rheumatic fever.

EFO:0001075	ovarian carcinoma	A malignant neoplasm originating from the surface ovarian epithelium. It accounts for the greatest number of deaths from malignancies of the female genital tract and is the fifth leading cause of cancer fatalities in women. It is predominantly a disease of older white women of northern European extraction, but it is seen in all ages and ethnic groups. Adenocarcinomas constitute the vast majority of ovarian carcinomas. The pattern of metastatic spread in ovarian carcinoma is similar regardless of the microscopic type. The most common sites of involvement are the contralateral ovary, peritoneal cavity, para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes, and liver. Lung and pleura are the most common sites of extra-abdominal spread. The primary form of therapy is surgical. The overall prognosis of ovarian carcinoma remains poor, a direct result of its rapid growth rate and the lack of early symptoms. --2002	carcinoma of the ovary;EOS;epithelial ovarian cancer;ovarian carcinoma;ovary carcinoma;ovarian cancer;carcinoma of ovary;ovarian epithelial cancer	ovarian carcinoma|malignant epithelial tumor of ovary|carcinoma|cancer|neoplasm|neoplastic disease or syndrome|cancer or benign tumor|disease|disposition|material property|experimental factor;

HP:0004348	Abnormality of bone mineral density	This term applies to all changes in bone mineral density which (depending on severity) can be seen on x-rays as a change in density and or structure of the bone. Changes may affect all bones of the organism, just certain bones or only parts of bones and include decreased mineralisation as may be seen in osteoporosis or increased mineralisation and or ossification as in osteopetrosis, exostoses or any kind of atopic calicfications of different origin and distribution. The overall amount of mineralization of the bone-organ can be measured as the amount of matter per cubic centimeter of bones, usually measured by densitometry of the lumbar spine or hip. The measurements are usually reported as g/cm3 or as a Z-score (the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for the patient's age and sex). Note that measurement with this method does not reflect local changes in other bones, and as such might not be correct with regard the hole bone-organ.

EFO:0001060	celiac disease	An autoimmune genetic disorder with an unknown pattern of inheritance that primarily affects the digestive tract. It is caused by intolerance to dietary gluten. Consumption of gluten protein triggers an immune response which damages small intestinal villi and prevents adequate absorption of nutrients. Clinical signs include abdominal cramping, diarrhea or constipation and weight loss. If untreated, the clinical course may progress to malnutrition, anemia, osteoporosis and an increased risk of intestinal malignancies. However, the prognosis is favorable with successful avoidance of gluten in the diet.

Tuberculosis (TB) may affect almost any tissue or organ of the body with the lungs being the most common site of infection. The clinical stages of TB are primary or initial infection, latent or dormant infection, and recrudescent or adult-type TB. Ninety to 95% of primary TB infections may go unrecognized. Histopathologically, tissue lesions consist of granulomas which usually undergo central caseation necrosis. Local symptoms of TB vary according to the part affected; acute symptoms include hectic fever, sweats, and emaciation; serious complications include granulomatous erosion of pulmonary bronchi associated with hemoptysis. If untreated, progressive TB may be associated with a high degree of mortality. This infection is frequently observed in immunocompromised individuals with AIDS or a history of illicit IV drug use.	tuberculosis disease	tuberculosis|primary bacterial infectious disease|bacterial disease|infectious disease|infectious disease or post-infectious disorder|disease|disposition|material property|experimental factor; tuberculosis|mycobacterial infectious disease|bacterial disease|infectious disease|infectious disease or post-infectious disorder|disease|disposition|material property|experimental factor; tuberculosis|primary bacterial infectious disease|material entity|experimental factor

EFO:0000182	hepatocellular carcinoma	A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.	hepatocellular cancer, somatic;hepatocellular carcinoma;carcinoma, hepatocellular, malignant;hepatocellular cancer;liver and intrahepatic bile duct carcinoma;carcinoma of liver cells;cancer, hepatocellular;carcinoma of liver;hepatoma;liver cell cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma);primary carcinoma of liver cells;hepatocellular carcinoma, somatic;carcinoma of the liver cells;hepatoblastoma, somatic;liver cell carcinoma;primary carcinoma of the liver cells;hepatocellular adenocarcinoma;hepatocellular carcinoma, childhood type, somatic;liver carcinoma;HCC	hepatocellular carcinoma|adenocarcinoma of liver and intrahepatic biliary tract|carcinoma of liver and intrahepatic biliary tract|liver cancer|liver and intrahepatic bile duct neoplasm|liver disease|endocrine system disease|disease|disposition|material property|experimental factor;

EFO:1001179	sialadenitis	Sialadenitis is an infection of the salivary glands. It is usually caused by a virus or bacteria. The parotid (in front ofthe ear) and submandibular (under the chin) glands are most commonly affected. Sialadenitis may be associated with pain, tenderness, redness, and gradual, localized swelling of the affected area. Sialadenitis most commonly affects the elderly and chronically ill especially those with dry mouth or who are dehydrated, but can also affected people of any age including newborn babies. Diagnosis is usually made by clinical exam but a CT scan, MRI scan or ultrasound may be done if the doctor suspects an abscess or to look for stones. Treatment may include an antibiotic (if bacterial), warm compresses, increasing fluid intake and good oral hygiene. Most salivary gland infections go away on their own or are cured with treatment. Complications are not common.

MONDO:0020121	muscular dystrophy	Muscular dystrophy (MD) refers to a group of more than 30 genetic diseases characterized by progressive weakness and degeneration of the skeletal muscles that control movement. Some forms of MD are seen in newborns, infants or children, while others have late-onset and may not appear until middle age or later. The disorders differ in terms of the distribution and extent of muscle weakness (some forms of MD also affect cardiac muscle), age of onset, rate of progression, and pattern of inheritance. The prognosis for people with MD varies according to the type and progression of the disorder. There is no specific treatment to stop or reverse any form of MD. Treatment is supportive and may include physical therapy, respiratory therapy, speech therapy, orthopedic appliances used for support, corrective orthopedic surgery, and medicationsincluding corticosteroids, anticonvulsants (seizure medications), immunosuppressants, and antibiotics. Some individuals may need assisted ventilation to treat respiratory muscle weaknessor a pacemaker for cardiac (heart)abnormalities.		muscular dystrophy|myopathy|muscle tissue disorder|muscular disease|musculoskeletal system disease|disease|disposition|material property|experimental factor; muscular dystrophy|skeletal muscle disorder|muscle tissue disorder|muscular disease|musculoskeletal system disease|disease|disposition|material property|experimental factor; muscular dystrophy|neuromuscular disease|neuropathy|nervous system disease|disease|disposition|material property|experimental factor

EFO:0000519	glioblastoma multiforme	The most malignant astrocytic tumor (WHO grade IV). It is composed of poorly differentiated neoplastic astrocytes and it is characterized by the presence of cellular polymorphism, nuclear atypia, brisk mitotic activity, vascular thrombosis, microvascular proliferation and necrosis. It typically affects adults and is preferentially located in the cerebral hemispheres. It may develop from diffuse astrocytoma WHO grade II or anaplastic astrocytoma (secondary glioblastoma, IDH-mutant), but more frequently, it manifests after a short clinical history de novo, without evidence of a less malignant precursor lesion (primary glioblastoma, IDH- wildtype).

MONDO:0007947	Marfan syndrome	A disorder of the connective tissue. Connective tissue provides strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body such as bones, ligaments, muscles, walls of blood vessels, and heart valves. Marfan syndrome affects most organs and tissues, especially the skeleton, lungs, eyes, heart, and the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the aorta). It is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called fibrillin-1. Marfan syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. At least 25% of cases are due to a new (de novo) mutation. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms in each person.

MONDO:0018634	hereditary amyloidosis	Hereditary amyloidosis refers to a group of inherited conditions that make up one of the subtypes of amyloidosis. Hereditary amyloidosisis characterized by the deposit of an abnormal protein called amyloid in multiple organs of the body where it should not be, which causes disruption of organ tissue structure and function. In hereditary amyloidosis, amyloid deposits most often occur in tissues of the heart, kidneys, and nervous system. While symptoms of hereditary amyloidosis may appear in childhood, most individuals do not experience symptoms until adulthood. There are many types of hereditary amyloidosis associated with different gene mutations and abnormal proteins. The most common type of hereditary amyloidosis is transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR),a condition in which the amyloid deposits are most often made up of the transthyretin protein which is made in the liver. Other examplesof hereditary amyloidosis include, but are not limited to, apolipoprotein AI amyloidosis (A ApoAI), gelsolin amyloidosis (A Gel), lysozyme amyloidosis (A Lys), cystatin C amyloidosis (A Cys), fibrinogen AÎ±-chain amyloidosis (A Fib), and apolipoprotein AII amyloidosis (A ApoAII). Most types of hereditary amyloidosis are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment is focused on addressing symptoms of organ damage and slowing down the production of amyloid when possible through methods such as liver transplants.	hereditary amyloidosis (disease);amyloidosis, Familial	hereditary amyloidosis|inborn errors of metabolism|genetic disorder|disease|disposition|material property|experimental factor; hereditary amyloidosis|amyloidosis|acquired metabolic disease|metabolic disease|disease|disposition|material property|experimental factor; hereditary amyloidosis|amyloidosis|acquired metabolic disease|material entity|experimental factor; hereditary amyloidosis|amyloidosis|proteostasis deficiencies|metabolic disease|disease|disposition|material property|experimental factor; hereditary amyloidosis|inborn errors of metabolism|metabolic disease|disease|disposition|material property|experimental factor; hereditary amyloidosis|inborn errors of metabolism|genetic disorder|material entity|experimental factor

The cause is unknown, but EM frequently occurs in association with herpes simplex virus, suggesting an immunologic process initiated by the virus. In half of the cases, the triggering agents appear to be medications, including anticonvulsants, sulfonamides, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and other antibiotics. In addition, some cases appear to be associated with infectious organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and many viral agents. Erythema multiforme is the mildest of three skin disorders that are often discussed in relation to each other. It is generally the mildest of the three. More severe is Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

EFO:0007157	aspergillosis	Aspergillosis is an infection, growth, or allergic response caused by the Aspergillus fungus. There are several different kinds of aspergillosis. One kind is allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (also called ABPA), a condition where the fungus causes allergic respiratory symptoms similar to asthma, such as wheezing and coughing, but does not actually invade and destroy tissue. Another kind of aspergillosis is invasive aspergillosis. This infection usually affects people with weakened immune systems due to cancer, AIDS, leukemia, organ transplantation, chemotherapy, or other conditions or events that reduce the number of normal white blood cells. In this condition, the fungus invades and damages tissues in the body. Invasive aspergillosis most commonly affects the lungs, but can also cause infection in many other organs and can spread throughout the body (commonly affecting the kidneys and brain). Aspergilloma, a growth (fungus ball) that develops in an area of previous lung disease such as tuberculosis or lung abscess, is a third kind of aspergillosis. This type of aspergillosis is composed of a tangled mass of fungus fibers, blood clots, and white blood cells. The fungus ball gradually enlarges, destroying lung tissue in the process, but usually does not spread to other areas.	infection due to Aspergillus;Aspergillosis;Infection due to Aspergillus;aspergillosis	aspergillosis|opportunistic mycosis|material entity|experimental factor; aspergillosis|opportunistic mycosis|fungal infectious disease|infectious disease|infectious disease or post-infectious disorder|disease|disposition|material property|experimental factor

EFO:1001219	trigeminal neuralgia	Trigeminal neuralgia is a nerve disorder that causes a stabbing or electric-shock-like pain in parts of the face. The pain lasts a few seconds to a few minutes, and usually on only one side of the face. It can also cause muscle spasms in the face the same time as the pain. The pain may result from a blood vessel pressing against the trigeminal nerve (the nerve that carries pain, feeling, and other sensations from the brain to the skin of theface), as a complication of multiple sclerosis, or due to compression of the nerve by a tumor or cyst. In some cases, the cause is unknown. Treatment options include medicines, surgery, and complementary approaches.
